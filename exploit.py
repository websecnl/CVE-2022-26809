# Turns out this is a bit more complicated to replicate
# There doesn't seem to be any user supplied input which can trigger the integer overflow
#
# At this point, i have tried to use Bindiff with IDA and find out the differences similar to what Marcus Hutchins says in the video explenation:
# I recommand you guys to watch it, its very interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGlwy3_jVYE
#
#
# Anyways, if any of you have any idea what configuration on RPC is required to be set and what the triggerpoint is to trigger the overflow then please feel free to report it
# in the GitHub repository issues section, any contribution is greatly appreciated.
